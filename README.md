# Monitor your internet speed

with [speedtest.net][1], [Grafana][2], [Telegraf][3], [InfluxDB][4] and [Docker][5].

Original https://github.com/raaaimund/internet-speed-monitor was outdated, and several things didnÂ´t work anymore.
Fixed them. Thanks to @raaaimund for the great setup! Just had to fix some dependencies of yours!

This project is fixed to the `x86` architecture.

After running

```
docker-compose up
```

Docker starts the following services

- influxdb
  - store for the speed test results
- speedtester
  - schedules a cron job for running a speed test using the official [speedtest.net cli][6] every five minutes to JSON log files
  - you can change the specified server and interval in the corresponding [Dockerfile][7]
- telegraf
  - reads the JSON logs with the results and sends them to influxdb
- grafana
  - visualizes the results on a simple pre-configured dashboard
  - default credentials are **admin:admin**

## Change speedtest server

Change the value of the `-s` argument in the [.env](./speedtest/Dockerfile) file to alter the server on which to perform the speed test. You can list nearby servers with `speedtest -L`.
